# How to Host Your Resume on GitHub Pages with Jekyll

This README will act as a guide to teach readers how to host a resume website on github pages. Normally this requires learning multiple programming languages and purchasing a domain name. However, by taking advantage of simplified programming languages used for documentation and free hosting services, anyone can set up a resume online that looks professional and custom made.

## Intended Audience

This guide is intended for beginners who have little to no experience with code, documentation, or website design, but are comfortable using a computer. It has a little technical jargon as possible, and assumes only that the user is able to navigate the internet and has an email address.

## Prerequisites

Users will need an email address and resume information on hand, possibly a photo of themselves too.
A GitHub account with a name that future employers will see. If using an account with an embarrassing name, consider creating a new account.

## Instructions

#### Setup

1. Search Google for a GitHub Pages resume template that you believe looks presentable. Here is an [**example**](https://github.com/sproogen/modern-resume-theme).
2. At the top of the page just under the GitHub website header, there will be a username/template name. Click the word "Fork" to the left of it and choose your own GitHub username from the pop-up list. A copy will be created as your own repository.
3. Alternatively, download a zip file of a resume template built for GitHub Pages.
4. Create a Respository with a professional name, such as Resume-Website.
5. Go to the settings tab and scroll down almost to the bottom, where a section is labeled "GitHub Pages". Choose the main branch as the source, and a link will be generated. This connects to the website.
6. Return to the main page and click "Upload files".
7. Extract the zip folder to a new folder, then drag and drop it onto GitHub in your browser to upload the files inside it.

#### Personalizing the template

1. Navigate to your new forked repository, and the folder marked config.yml.
2. In the right hand corner above the text, click the pen icon to edit the page. Replace the default information with your own.
3. Scroll to the bottom of the page and click commit to save the changes.
4. Navigate to the data folder, and repeat the process with the files in that folder.
5. Any experience sections that are not relevant to you may be deleted, or replaced with relevant sections that apply to your resume and experience.
6. At the top of the main repository page is a optional description heading. Click edit, and insert the url for your website. This url can be copied from the settings tab under "GitHub Pages".
7. If your template has the space for a photo, upload one of the specified format using the "Upload Files" button inside the folder where photos are stored.

## FAQs
**Q**: Isn't copying someone's website template considered pirating? Shouldn't I pay for it or something?
**A**: The creator will usually indicate that the template if for public use. Some create them as examples of their own skills. Others as a public service simply because they can. Most will include a way to contact them for feedback, and links to patreons or other websites that accept payment are common to support the creators. Sending them some financial support is always appreciated!
**Q**: My website isn't showing the changes I made! Do I need to press some button or push a commit?
**A**: Github pages updates after at most 10 minutes the first time it gets set up, and after less than a minute after a change is submitted. Give it more time and it will display correctly.
