# How to Host Your Resume on GitHub Pages with Jekyll

This README will act as a guide to teach readers how to host a resume website on github pages. Normally this requires learning multiple programming languages and purchasing a domain name. However, by taking advantage of simplified programming languages used for documentation and free hosting services, anyone can set up a resume online that looks professional and custom made.

## Intended Audience

This guide is intended for beginners who have little to no experience with code, documentation, or website design. It has a little technical jargon as possible, and assumes only that the user is able to navigate the internet and has an email address.

## Prerequisites

Users will need an email address and resume information on hand.
Create a GitHub account with a name that future employers will see.

## Instructions

#### Setup

1. Search Google for a GitHub Pages resume template that you believe looks presentable. Here is an [**example**](https://github.com/sproogen/modern-resume-theme).
2. At the top of the page just under the GitHub website header, there will be a username/template name. On the left end of the line is the word "Fork". Click this and choose your own GitHub username from the pop-up list. A copy will be created as your own repository.

#### Personalizing the template

3. Navigate to your new forked repository, and the folder marked config.yml.
4. In the right hand corner above the text, click the pen icon to edit the page. Replace the default information with your own.
5. Scroll to the bottom of the page and click commit to save the changes.
6. Navigate to the data folder, and repeat the process with the files in that folder.
7. Any experience sections that are not relevant to you may be deleted, or replaced with relevant sections that apply to your resume and experience.
