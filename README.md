# How to Host Your Resume on GitHub Pages with Jekyll

This README will act as a guide to teach users how to host a resume website on github pages using a Jekyll template written in Markdown. Normally this requires learning multiple programming languages and purchasing a domain name. However, by taking advantage of simplified programming languages used for documentation and free hosting services, anyone can set up a resume online that looks professional and custom made. And while it is not nearly as expensive or as difficult as creating a website from scratch, donating to template creators is always advised.

## Intended Audience

This guide is intended for beginners who have little to no experience with code, documentation, or website design, but are comfortable using a computer. It has a little technical jargon as possible, and assumes only that the user is able to navigate the internet and has an email address.

## Prerequisites

Users will need an email address and resume information on hand, possibly a photo of themselves too.
A GitHub account with a name that future employers will see. If using an account with an embarrassing name, consider creating a new account.

## Instructions

#### Setup

1. Search Google for a GitHub Pages resume template that you believe looks presentable. Here is an [**example**](https://github.com/sproogen/modern-resume-theme).
2. At the top of the page just under the GitHub website header, there will be a username/template name. Click the word "Fork" to the left of it and choose your own GitHub username from the pop-up list. A copy will be created as your own repository.
#### Alternative Setup
1. Download a zip file of a resume template built for GitHub Pages.
2. Create a Respository with a professional name, such as Name's-Resume-Website.
3. Click on the settings tab and scroll down almost to the bottom, where a section is labeled "GitHub Pages".
4. Choose the main branch as the source, and a link will be generated. This connects to the website.
5. Return to the main page and click "Upload files".
6. Extract the zip folder to a new folder.
7. Drag and drop the unzipped folder contents into the GitHub browser tab to upload the files inside it.

#### Personalizing the template

1. Navigate to your new forked repository.
2. Click the folder marked config.yml.
3. In the right hand corner above the text, click the pen icon to edit the page.
4. Replace the default information inside each file with your resume information.
5. Scroll to the bottom of the page and click "commit" to save the changes.
6. Navigate to the data folder and repeat steps 3-5 with the files in that folder.
7. Any experience sections that are not relevant to you may be deleted, or replaced with relevant sections that apply to your resume and experience.
8. Click on the Settings tab.
9. Copy the url under the GitHub Pages section. 
10. Return to the main repository page.
11. Paste the url into the optional description at the top of the page.
11. Upload a photo of yourself into the images or assets file, if your template has an option for a self portrait.

## FAQs

**Q**: Isn't copying someone's website template considered pirating? Shouldn't I pay for it or something?  
**A**: The creator will usually indicate that the template if for public use. Some create them as examples of their own skills. Others as a public service simply because they can. Most will include a way to contact them for feedback, and links to patreons or other websites that accept payment are common to support the creators. Sending them some financial support is always appreciated!  
**Q**: My website isn't showing the changes I made! Do I need to press some button or push a commit?  
**A**: Github pages updates after at most 10 minutes the first time it gets set up, and after less than a minute after a change is submitted. Give it more time and it will display correctly.
