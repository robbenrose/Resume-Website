    While at the U of M I joined three clubs that introduced me to the Computer Science community and the joy of working in a team. I am enjoying my time at university and learning a lot about maintaining a healthy work life balance.

    I spent a lot of my free time as a Lounge supervisor of the *Computer Science Student Association* assisting members as a tutor.
